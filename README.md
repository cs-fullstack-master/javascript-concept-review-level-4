# JavaScript Review 4 - Functions, Loops, Function prtotype classes
This 5 challenge review covers core JavaScript concepts and is expected to take Students 1.5 hr or less

## Directions
* Create a new public GitHub repository called `javascript-concept-review-level-1`
* Clone repository and copy the contents of this README file to your README 
* Create `index.html`,`style.css`, and `main.js` files in your project
* Code your answers to each of the 5 questions using the Standard JavaScript Template described below:

> NOTE: Start with a separate JavaScript file with a function called *main()*. This should be the first function called and point of entry for execution. All other code to accomplish whatever challenge should be in it's own function called from the main() function. No JavaScript code should execute outside of a function. This pattern should be considered our 'Standard JavaScript Template' for all exercises.
```
main() {
    // call exercise1()
    // call excercise2()
    // etc.
}
```
Before you type ANY CODE, write out your steps to solve each exercise in each file. Use single line comments to pseudocode what you need to do to solve the problem *then* fill in the blanks.
```
// JUST AN EXAMPLE!
// Create an array
// Load objects into the array
// Iterate through each element in the array and print the element
```

### 1. Loops and User Input
Create a loop that takes user input (input can be anything, anmes. shopping items, etc.) and adds it to an array. Once the user quits by entering `quit`, print all items in the array. DO NOT print the array directly, print the items/elements in the array by iterating through them. - Note: Make user input *case-insensitive*.

### 2: Conditionals
Create a function that can translate five English words of your choosing into Spanish words. You can use conditionals with `if` or stretch with `switch-case`.

### 3: Function prototype classes
Put the start of your program in a main function. Create a class (with prototype) for `Books` with `name`, `rating`, `genre`, and `author`. Create a class method that will change the `rating` of the book. Create three objects of the class `Book` and put them in an array. Lastly, use the array and display all books and their properties to the console or browser.
